#This is record the python code I have doing before\


Content: 2:**Creating a Python Package**\
**mymath file**\
First create a Module file - stats.py , basic.py\
Second create a __init__.py
Then will use the follow step:\
-At the terminal type python3 to invoke python interpreter.\
-Once the python interpreter is loaded.\
-At the python prompt type import mymath\
-If the above command runs without errors, it is an indication that the mymath package is successfully loaded.\
-At the python prompt type mymath.basic.add(3,4)\
-You should see an output 7 on the screen.\
-At the python prompt type mymath.stats.mean([3,4,5])\
-You should see an output 4.0 on the screen.\
-Type exit() to quit python interpreter.\

*I create a Practice Exercise to create a new Module :arearectangleandcircle.py \

**This program is Hand-on Lab practice from IBM Coursera\
